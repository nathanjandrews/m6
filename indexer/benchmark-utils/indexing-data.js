  one file, with one header for the entire file.  This is to keep
  the overhead down, and in response to requests from Gopher site
  keeper to eliminate as much of the headers as possible.

  However, for legal and financial reasons, we must request these
  headers be left at the beginning of each file that is posted in
  any general user areas, as Project Gutenberg is run mostly by a
  donation from people like you.`},

  `We apologize for the fact that the legal small print is longer,
  and more complicated, than the Etext itself, our legal beagles,
  of whom there are now a half dozen or so, insist this must be a
  part of any Project Gutenberg Etext we post, for our protection
  from the rest of the legal beagles out there.  The US has twice
  as many lawyers as the rest of the world combined!

  You are free to delete the headers and just keep the Etexts, we
  are not free not to post it this way.  Again my apologies.  The
  normal Project Gutenberg blurb has been deleted, you can get it
  in this location in most Project Gutenberg Etexts.  Thanks,  mh`},

  `We observe today not a victory of party but a celebration of freedom. . .
  symbolizing an end as well as a beginning. . .signifying renewal
  as well as change for I have sworn before you and Almighty God
  the same solemn oath our forbears prescribed nearly a century
  and three-quarters ago.

  The world is very different now, for man holds in his mortal hands
  the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life.
  And yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forbears fought
  are still at issue around the globe. . .the belief that the rights of man
  come not from the generosity of the state but from the hand of God.
  We dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution.`},
